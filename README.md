miniscript utilities for Stardew Valley Farmtronics mod


This is just a .ms file with some tools for farming. Automated farming is accomplished by placing wood and stone signs, which signal the bot to turn left or right (respectively). The bot will automatically farm all dirt in its path, including planting seeds, fertilizing, watering, and harvesting. Harvesting crops that "drop" produce (e.g. potatoes) currently does not work due to farmtronics and smapi limitations; those crops are left on the ground, and can be picked up by the farmer, but will not be placed into the bot's inventory.

Read brief documentation above each function for info on how it works and what it does.
